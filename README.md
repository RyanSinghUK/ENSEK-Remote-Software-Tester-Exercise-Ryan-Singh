Deliverables:

- `ENSEK - TC001 ‚Äì Happy Path - Full Inventory Purchase ‚Äì Gas Energy.pdf` ‚Äì Happy Path Test Execution with screenshots
- `ENSEK - TC002 ‚Äì Unhappy Path - Quantity of Units cannot be less than 0 ‚Äì Electricity Energy.pdf` ‚Äì Unhappy Path Test Execution with screenshots (Linked Defect)
- `DEF-001 ENSEK Energy Portal (Buy Energy ‚Äì Electricity) allows purchase of more units than available (Inventory becomes negative).pdf` ‚Äì Defect Sample Temp late (linked to TC002)

## üìÅ Section 3: REST API Testing

A fully implemented Playwright-based test automation framework designed to validate the REST API exposed by ENSEK. This framework includes:

- Token-based authentication and request context management
- End-to-end validation of core API scenarios:
  - Resetting test data
  - Purchasing all fuel types (Gas, Electric, Oil, Nuclear)
  - Verifying orders are correctly listed
  - Filtering orders created before the current date
  - Validating deletion of specific orders
- Shared utility functions and test data management (e.g. dynamic order ID storage)
- Serial execution strategy for interdependent test flows
- HTML reporting integrated and exported for CI review

Tests can be executed locally or via the GitHub Actions CI pipeline.

Deliverables:

- `playwright-report/` ‚Äì HTML Test Report
- `tests/api/` ‚Äì Playwright TypeScript API tests (version-controlled)
